# CSE 360 RAG Chatbot

An AI teaching assistant that helps CSE 360 students by providing accurate answers from past Ed Discussion posts. Built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure responses are grounded in official course content.

## How It Works

This chatbot uses advanced AI techniques to provide reliable answers about course content:

1. **Fetching Ed Discussion Content**: Ed Discussion posts are fetched directly from the ed discussion API and sent to our endpoint /api/ingest-batch
1. **Vector Database Storage**: Ingest batch generates embeddings for each post and stores them in a vector database
2. **Semantic Search**: When the user asks a question, the system performs semantic search to find the most relevant past discussions
3. **Contextual Responses**: GPT-4o synthesizes information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive, accurate answers
4. **Source Citations**: Every response includes links to the original Ed Discussion posts
